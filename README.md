# account_number_verify

A single screen app that confirms if a bank account number is authentic.

The user selects a bank in the DropDown and inputs an account number in the TextField,
and with the click of a button, the app makes an api call to PayStack.

If the api call is successful, the account number 'name' and 'number' is displayed
for the user to see.
